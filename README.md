Credit to Derek Banas for the tutorial on how to make this app.
While he showed me how to give basic functionality this app, here's the list of things I added without his help:
- Clear Button
- Memory Add
- Memory Clear
- Memory

# How to compile this app

1. Clone the repository to your computer 
2. Using Qt Creator 4.12.2, open calculator.pro
3. Hit Cmd + R (Mac) or CNTL + R (Win) to compile the application

# What I learned building this app
